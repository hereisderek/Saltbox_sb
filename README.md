this is a fork of the saltbox's installation script, that removes the blockers to allow install on an ubuntu lxc on a proxmox environment.


to install, run the following command

`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hereisderek/Saltbox_sb/v2/sb_install.sh | bash -s -v && cd /srv/git/saltbox`
